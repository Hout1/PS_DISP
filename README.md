PS_DISP is a bundle script written on bash shell and Matlab code. The script requires Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and Matlab Software and runs under Linux operating system. The purpose of PS DISP is to generate 2D or 3D vectors displacement from InSAR both ascending and descending orbit either from the mean velocity or time series data.

How to use PS_DISP, please read --> Guideline_ps_disp.pdf
